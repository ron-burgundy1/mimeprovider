MimeProvider
------------

Small framework component for pyramid to serialize/deserializer resources
depending on mimetypes.

This project is suitable for data driven REST api's, it adapts to the standard
negotation in HTTPs, or specifically the Accept and Content-Type headers to
decide the format and type of incoming and outgoing resources.

Example
-------

see examples/small_application.py

If you boot up the example application, you will see the magic in action.

    curl http://localhost:8080/missing -H "Accept: */*" -v

or surf to the same address, notice that it serves a minimal html page
describing the resource.

    curl http://localhost:8080/missing -H "Accept: */*" -H "Content-Type: application/somedata+json" --data '{"string": "Oh No", "integer": 42, "somelist": [1, 2, 3, 4]}'

The sole responsibility for this project is to assert that types are negotiated correctly, and are clearly distinguished from formats.
In order to build a fully functional API there are still a few steps necessary.

* Schema validation
* Database access (if applicable)
* Data binding (from front-end data types to backend)
